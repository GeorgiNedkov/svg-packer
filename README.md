# SVG Builder

## Setup & Usage

Place your SVG files inside the svg-builder/svgs directory.

Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
cd svg-builder
```

Install dependencies (use npm or pnpm):

```sh
npm install

# or

pnpm install
```

Run the builder:

```sh
node index.js
```

Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

The SVG assets were re-exported with figma.
SVG standards can sometimes behave inconsistently across tools, but Figma provided the most reliable exports for this workflow.
