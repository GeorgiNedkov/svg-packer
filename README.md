# Simple SVG sprite sheet generator

It takes a folder of SVGs and generates a single larger SVG along with a JSON file that indicates the position of each individual SVG.

## Setup & Usage

Place your SVG files inside the svg-builder/svgs directory.

Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
cd svg-builder
```

Install dependencies (use npm or pnpm):

```sh
npm install

# or

pnpm install
```

Run the builder:

```sh
node index.js
```

Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰

## Notes

Currently, this works only if the viewBox width and height match the SVGâ€™s width and height. The SVG assets were re-exported from Figma, since thatâ€™s Figmaâ€™s default behavior.

The SVG atlas follows the TexturePacker JSON structure, which means itâ€™s compatible with tools like Pixi.js, Babylon.js, or any framework that can rasterize the SVG before sending it to the GPU as a texture.

## pixi-app

it is just for example usage

## Result

### json

[json](svg-builder/svgAtlas-0.json)

### svg

![svg](svg-builder/svgAtlas-0.svg)
